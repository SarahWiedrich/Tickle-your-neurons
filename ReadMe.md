The inspiration for this game came from the love of my family to play trivia games while traveling in the car, to help us stay awake and pass the time! The question inspiration came from a trivia game we LOVED to play as kids called "You don't know JACK". It had the craziest questions and super quirky! Plus I always like learning new and ineresting things!

To play simply read the question, and take a stab at the correct answer. For every correct answer you get 1 point with a maximum of 12 points avaliable.

Your question tally is in the upper left corner. This well tell you how many total questions you have, as well as how many you have answered so far.

Your score will tally in the upper right corner.

Good luck!
