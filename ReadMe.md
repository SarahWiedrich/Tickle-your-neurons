Tickle Your Neurons is fun filled trivia game that will make you think outside the box with its unique and quirky questions!

The inspiration for this project came from the love of my family to test our knowledge with trivia and learn something new! One of our favorite things to do on long road trips is to play family games such as trivia to helps pass the time! 

The questions I used in this project came from a trivia game we LOVED to play as kids called "You don't know JACK". If you've never played it and you love trivia, I highly recommend you check it out! Its unlike another trivia game. It's quirky and super fun!

How to Play:
    -Simply read the question displayed on the right, take a stab at the correct answer by clicking one of the buttons on the right.
    -If you answered correctly the button will display green. If not, it will display red. 
    -For every correct answer you get 1 point which will show up in the upper right corner. You can earn a maximum of 12 points.
    -In the upper left corner, you will notice the question counter. This well tell you what question you are on, and the total number of questions available.
    -Once you answer the last question, an alert box will pop up to let you know you have completed the game.
    -You will also notice nestled under the buttons is an option do have some fun "thinking music" play in the background as you enjoy the game. You can choose to play in silence, but if you'd like some fun music to go along with your fun questions simply click the play button. The music will continue to loop until you stop it by pressing the pause button.

Features I'd like to add to this project in the future:
    -Instead of an alert box to notify the game is over, I'd like to add some fun fireworks or confetti pouring down. Some kind of celebration that is entertaining! I tried adding confetti via CSS and JS but unfortunately was unsuccessful in implementing it properly into my code.....YET!
    -I would also like to implement that when the question is answered incorrectly; not only does the wrong answer show red, but the right answer displays in green at the same time.
    -I'd also like to have it tack high scores and the player’s name.

I enjoy trivia because I’m always learning something new and interesting. My hope is by playing this game you will also learn something new and interesting today! Have fun!!

Good luck!
